#+TITLE: Inbox

This file is used to hold raw todo items from ~org-capture~ before being further
processed.

We can capture items directly into this file with something like

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-capture-templates '(("t" "Todo [inbox]" entry
                               (file+headline "~/gtd/inbox.org" "Tasks")
                               "* TODO %i%?")))
#+end_src

Items in this file should be processed regularly (e.g., daily) and refile to
other files. Refile targets can be set with something like

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-refile-targets '(("~/gtd/gtd.org" :maxlevel . 3)
                           ("~/gtd/someday.org" :level . 1)
                           ("~/gtd/tickler.org" :maxlevel . 2)))
#+end_src
